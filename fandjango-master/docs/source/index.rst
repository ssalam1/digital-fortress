Overview
^^^^^^^^

If you're new to Facebook applications, you should read Facebook's surprisingly
excellent `documentation <http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/>`_
before continuing. The rest of the documentation will assume you're at least
passingly familiar with the material contained within.
